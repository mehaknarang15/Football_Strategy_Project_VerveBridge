# Football_Strategy_Project_VerveBridge
In the highly competitive world of football, where split-second decisions can determine the outcome of a game, understanding the underlying patterns and confidence levels behind these decisions is crucial. This dashboard not only highlights which strategies are most commonly employed but also provides insight into the confidence and trust that teams place in each option. By analyzing these metrics, we can identify trends, uncover potential areas for improvement, and make data-driven recommendations that can enhance on-field performance and decision-making processes.
